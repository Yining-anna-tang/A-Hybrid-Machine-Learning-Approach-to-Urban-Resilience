Urban Resilience, Machine Learning, and Social Stability (China, 2010–2021)

📌 Project Overview
What is the contribution of fostering inclusive and resilient cities?
This project examines how urban resilience shapes social stability under external shocks, moving beyond traditional static and equilibrium-based approaches in urban resilience research. Using a multidimensional, data-driven framework, we analyze 286 Chinese cities over the period 2010–2021 and integrate machine learning, explainable AI, and configurational causal analysis to generate both robust predictions and policy-relevant mechanisms.

🎯 Research Contributions
This study makes five key contributions:
Dynamic perspective on urban resilience
We conceptualize urban resilience as a dynamic process that conditions social stability under shocks, rather than a static equilibrium outcome.
Multidimensional resilience measurement
A 60-variable urban resilience index is constructed for 286 Chinese cities (2010–2021), capturing institutional capacity, infrastructure redundancy, and social vulnerability.
High-performance machine learning prediction
We develop and validate a hybrid CatBoost–Random Forest model to predict social stability outcomes, achieving strong predictive accuracy
(RMSE = 0.0355, R² = 0.969).
Explainable and interpretable policy insights
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is applied to quantify the marginal contribution of key resilience factors, enhancing transparency for policy use.
Configurational causal mechanisms
Using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), we identify multiple causal pathways through which combinations of resilience conditions jointly support social stability, demonstrating that no single factor is sufficient across contexts.

🧠 Conceptual Framework
The study is framed by the Antecedents–Decisions–Outcomes (ADO) model:
Antecedents: governance capacity, institutional quality, and infrastructural foundations
Decisions: policy prioritization and resilience investment pathways
Outcomes: urban resilience performance and social stability
This framework links governance and infrastructure conditions to downstream resilience outcomes through decision-making processes.

🛠 Methods Summary
Urban Resilience Index:
60 indicators across institutional, infrastructural, and social dimensions
Machine Learning:
Hybrid CatBoost + Random Forest model for prediction
Explainable AI:
SHAP for feature attribution and marginal effect interpretation
Causal Inference:
fsQCA to identify multiple sufficient configurations

📊 Key Findings
Cities with strong institutions, redundant infrastructure, and lower social vulnerability are more resilient to shocks.
High social stability can be achieved through different combinations of resilience conditions.
There is no one-size-fits-all pathway to resilience.
Explainable machine learning can support transparent and accountable policy decisions.

🌍 Policy Implications
Supports evidence-based governance reform
Enables transparent use of ML models in public decision-making
Informs equitable allocation of resilience resources across cities
Aligns resilience investment with social stability outcomes
